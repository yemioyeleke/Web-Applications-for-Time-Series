CavaAnnotate is a specialized deployed web application designed for annotating eye movement data images, specifically those related to episodes of dizziness or vertigo experienced by patients wearing a medical wearable device. All annotated image files are securely stored in the web application's backend database and are also made available for training machine learning algorithms.
